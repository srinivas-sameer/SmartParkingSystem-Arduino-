# SmartParkingSystem-Arduino-
This project presents the basic concept of using app based smart parking services in smart cities as an important application of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. This system will be accessible through a mobile app called BLYNK and can be used to monitor or find the empty slots in that area.

Components used for this project are:

Arduino board
Node MCU
Jumper Wires
USB Cable
IR Sensors
LEDs
BLYNK app for mobile.
